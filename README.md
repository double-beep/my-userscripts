This is a repository I store my userscripts.

## Remove the Products button

Latest version: **v1.2.0**

The userscript is intended to remove the <kbd>Products</kbd> button which Stack Overflow added recently to earn money. This has caused lots of bugs and complaints:

- [No way to access review queues from homepage](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/387105)
- [Accessibility issue - Tabbed navigation skips the new "Products" menu](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/387011)
- **[New home page makes it seem like SO doesn't allow free use any more](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/386505)**
- [Add option to hide Products menu](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/386393)
- [Review button disappears upon loading of the screen](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/386389)
- [The top bar no longer displays the moderator flag queue after the new "Products" menu](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/386325)
- [Where did the top bar menu go?](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/386293)
- [Flickering of search bar with new Products menu](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/386288)

With lots of upcoming. With this userscript, it is removed entirely.

## Queen Controls

Latest version: **1.2**

The userscript is adapted from [Belisarius Controls](https://github.com/SOBotics/Userscripts/blob/master/Belisarius/Belisarius_Controls.user.js) to suit to the Queen reports. Queen reports comments and gets tp (true positive), nc (not constructive), fp (false positive) and sk (skip) feedback. Here is how a report is without the userscript:

## CopyPastor Reporter

Latest version: **2.3.5**

The userscripted is clearly adapted from [Sentinel Reported](https://github.com/SOBotics/Userscripts/SentinelReporter/raw/master/SentinelReporter.user.js), but this is much shorter. It adds ✔️ (tp/k) and ❌ (fp/f) buttons to the CopyPastor page.

How does it work? In a report page it shows two buttons, press one according to what you think: is the post really plagiarism or not?
