## Remove the Products button

The userscript is intended to remove the <kbd>Products</kbd> button which Stack Overflow added recently to earn money. This has caused lots of bugs and complaints:

- [No way to access review queues from homepage](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/387105)
- [Accessibility issue - Tabbed navigation skips the new "Products" menu](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/387011)
- **[New home page makes it seem like SO doesn't allow free use any more](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/386505)**
- [Add option to hide Products menu](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/386393)
- [Review button disappears upon loading of the screen](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/386389)
- [The top bar no longer displays the moderator flag queue after the new "Products" menu](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/386325)
- [Where did the top bar menu go?](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/386293)
- [Flickering of search bar with new Products menu](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/386288)

With lots of upcoming. With this userscript, it is removed entirely.
